###Usage

`$ sh script.sh filename`

Ex: `$ sh script.sh airvpn.txt`

PIng baSH => I did not have much imagination when I had to choose the name :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Bash script to ping multiple IP in less than 10 secondes

This script is useful to choose the server of a VPN service with the best response time.

###File format

airvpn.txt contains the list of name and IP of AirVPN.org servers

You can create your own list in the format:
`NAME:IPv4`

If you don't have the name, just use the format:
`:IPv4`
